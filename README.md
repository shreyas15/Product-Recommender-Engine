## Proposed Project
In this project we use a large dataset of over 3.5GiB of user browsing data to model a Recommender Engine to make suggestions based on user interests using Apache Spark.

## Data Source
We use the data available from Yahoo! Research. The data set being [Yahoo Data Targeting User Modeling, Version 1.0.](https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=a&did=78)  

This data set contains a small sample of user profiles and their interests generated from several months of user activities at Yahoo webpages. Each user is represented as one feature vector and its associated labels, where all user identifiers were removed. Feature vectors are derived from user activities during a training period of 90 days, and labels from a test period of 2 weeks that immediately followed the training period. Each dimension of the feature vector quantifies a user activity with a certain interest category from an internal Yahoo taxonomy (e.g., "Sports/Baseball", "Travel/Europe"), calculated from user interactions with pages, ads, and search results, all of which are internally classified into these interest categories. The labels are derived in a similar way, based on user interactions with classified pages, ads, and search results during the test period. It is important to note that there exists a hierarchical structure among the labels, which is also provided in the data set.


## Business Use Case/ Advantage
Many companies these days target audiences based on their interest and it becomes imperetive for organizations to determine what user interests are. For example, if a new advertisement, product propmotion or offer is to be marketed, users can be targeted based on their last purchase or previous purchases over a period of time. It is hard for companies to iterate and manually determine various category of users from a database by altering different parameters - it becomes a tedious and a rather elaborate and expensive process. 
So, we need to make the system smarter by implementing a machine learning algortihm to automatically learn from the data that the company has and make predictions suitably. This can help in the retail segment significantly to solve the shelf-size problem. It can also help manufacturers and retailers to stock necessary products.

## Technology / Tools Proposed
1) Amazon AWS - S3, EMR instances - Amazon EMR makes it easy to launch a Hadoop cluster and install many of the Hadoop ecosystem applications, such as Pig, Hive, HBase, and Spark. EMR makes it easy for data scientists to create clusters quickly and process vast amounts of data in a few clicks. EMR also integrates with other AWS big data services such as Amazon S3 for low-cost durable storage.

2) Apache Spark - We explore Sparkâ€™s MLlib and program using pySpark.

3) Apache Zepplin - A web-based notebook that enables interactive data analytics. We can make beautiful data-driven, interactive and collaborative documents with SQL, Scala and more.
